While it is technically correct that every cereal listing sugar first is mostly sugar, that information isn't helpful:  most cereal companies simply use smaller quantities of many sugary sweeteners so that none of them show up first in the ingredients list. Examples: corn syrup, malt syrup, honey, agave.")

So high-fiber cereals will probably have less sugar in the same size serving than other cereals.  Plus, fiber helps maintain 'regularity.' ")

You may miss a good one who is younger and more up to date, just because their practice is new and they don’t have enough ratings. Second, patients tend to rate what they see – good interpersonal skills, on-time performance, even pleasant waiting rooms. These are important attributes but may not correlate with the 'best' doctor.");
