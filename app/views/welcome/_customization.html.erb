<p>We can add, subtract, move/emphasize or change the wording of questions for your employee population.   If your employees are or arenâ€™t at a high education level, we can change the positions of questions to favor novice, intermediate or advanced.   (The questions automatically sort themselves by age, gender and smoking status of course.  We typically advise not sorting by weight because of the importance of not asking employees personal questions, but we can do so if requested.)  We work with you to determine the big health-related issues in your organization.  Back pain/musculoskeletal?  Overutilization?  Imaging? Pharmacy?  Caesarian sections?  Heart attacks?  Obesity?  Did we mention back pain/musculoskeletal? And then we emphasize those categories.</p>
