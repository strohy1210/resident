      <h3><strong>Our “Gold Standard” Validation</strong></h3>
      From The Validation Institute. Quizzify is one of the few population health companies that truly has an impact and captures that impact in its contractual language.<br> <p>(Many vendors will “guarantee” improvements – but those are <a href="http://theysaidwhat.net/2014/07/23/cigna001/" target="_blank">"improvements"</a> that would have happened anyway. Hence they can’t get this “Gold Standard” validation even though it’s free.)

      <h3><strong>Why Quizzify?</strong></h3>
      <span class="mission"><strong><h4>Quizzify teaches your employees to be health ninjas,<br> One quiz at a time</strong></h4></span>
      What if we could solve all the problems of wellness?  What if we could save money, boost morale, improve health and engage employees…and do it without invading privacy, requiring personal health information, violating clinical guidelines, or shaming people who fail?  And what if we could guarantee each of those things?

      <h3><strong>Our Guarantee</strong></h3>
      <span class="vcenter">Because we're so sure of our impact, <a href="#guarantee">we put 50% of our fees on the line.</a> We also customize our product to your needs and will match the price of any “pry, poke, and prod” wellness vendor.</span>
