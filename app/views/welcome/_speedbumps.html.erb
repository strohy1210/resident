<h2>The Quizzify Speedbumps</h2>
<p>Answering one or two or three multiple-choice questions on some topics isn’t enough to truly impart the lessons on healthcare spending you’d like your employees to learn.  For the 20-30 most overused, misunderstood, and/or hazardous procedures, diagnostics and therapies –either in your own experience or using our pre-selected list – we provide in-depth tutorials.  We call these “Speedbumps” because we are encouraging employees to slow down before leaping into the treatment trap, in order to learn more about what they are about to do.

  <p>For instance, most people who get CT scans are not told that they need to have dye injected through an IV or that they will be exposed to radiation 100 to 1000 times greater than an X-ray.  Most people who sign up for spinal fusions don’t realize that a huge percentage of these painful surgical fixes don’t “take” and/or were not needed in the first place.
  <p>The incentive to “Speedbump” these interventions:  Employees who take and pass these quizzes get a (non-transferable) credit towards the intervention in question – should they still want to follow through with it after learning more about it.   Some significant number of employees – once they learn the unvarnished reality about some of these overhyped and underwhelming (but very profitable) proposed interventions – will decide to pass on them altogether, while others will at least be considerably more educated about their pitfalls and potential harms, which should facilitate a faster recovery and return to work.  
  <p>We are guaranteeing that by Year 3, the savings from reducing the number of people who follow through with these high-cost, low-value trips into the “treatment trap” will more than offset the cost of the entire Quizzify program, not just cost of the Speedbumps themselves.
  Further, because the Quizzify questions and Speedbumps cover wellness topics along with waste and overuse, we also guarantee a reduction in wellness-sensitive medical events by Year 3.  (If you split your population in half, we guarantee that the Quizzify half will actually outperform the wellness half…in the wellness wheelhouse of wellness-sensitive medical events.  That’s how much more compelling education is than “pry, poke and prod” programs.)
