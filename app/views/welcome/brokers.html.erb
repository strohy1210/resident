Information for Brokers
Attention, Non-Brokers:  Do Not Read This Section.  If you do, you might learn something that other vendors won’t tell you.
There are more than 1000 wellness vendors.  None other than ourselves admits on their websites to paying fees to brokers, but almost all do.  Why is that?  Because brokers represent the customer while getting compensated by the vendor.  Typically the wellness vendor encrypts language under their “For Brokers” section to read something like:  “We partner with you” or convey even more disingenuous attempts to assure brokers that they’ll get paid--while not alerting customers to the uncomfortable reality that “their” broker is being paid by the wellness vendor.  
In sharp contrast, the Quizzify commitment to integrity is to be quite upfront about this:  we pay commissions.  Note: we won’t pay you more than wellness vendors pay.  That’s not how we want to win your allegiance.   We want to win your allegiance the same way we win customers:  by providing the only offering that is USPSTF-compliant, EEOC-inoculated and most importantly guaranteed to be the most fun an employee can have while learning how to become an educated and careful spender of their own and their employer’s health dollars—which is also guaranteed.  
We will, however “partner” with you in the truest sense of the word, by working side-by-side to ensure smooth implementation and ongoing execution of Quizzify.
