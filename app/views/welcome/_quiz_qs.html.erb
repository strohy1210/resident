<h2>Quizzify Questions</h2>
<p>The questions are all over the healthcare map.
They cover children and aging parents. They cover not just how to stay healthy, but also what to do when you’re not. Far more Americans are harmed by too much healthcare than too little.  Our mantra: just because it’s healthcare doesn’t mean it’s good for you.

  <p>And there are no clichés in our questions.  For instance, no lectures on that perennial HRA mainstay:  buckling your seatbelt.  Employees who don’t buckle their seat belts now aren’t going to start because a computer tells them to.   
  <p>Nor do we even tell people to stop smoking.  If you have smokers who don’t realize they should stop (or for that matter don’t realize they should buckle their seat belts), you’ve got bigger problems.  Instead, we are much more subtle about it.  For instance, we might ask how much extra a 30-year-old smoker in the 25% tax bracket needs to earn in order to pay for this habit over a lifetime.  It turns out this figure has a lot of digits in it.
  <p>Or, we might have a question asking smokers what it means if they see substantial blood in their urine.  (ANS: Probably bladder cancer, one of the lesser-appreciated cancers tied closely to smoking.)   These are more subtle ways of noodging people into smoking cessation than lecturing at them.  And as noted, we can also help smokers find their way to cessation programs or incentives that you offer but that they don’t know about.
  <p>The questions are written to be accessible, entertaining, occasionally funny (just occasionally—hey, you try writing an amusing question on bladder cancer)…and educational. <p>Unlike in wellness where widespread cheating on HRAs encourages a culture of deceit and a lot of laughter at your expense, we want employees to cheat.  Cheating is good.  Because of the way the rewards are designed (typically $1.00 for each right answer less $0.25 for each wrong one), there is an incentive to get the answers right by looking them up.  And that’s how people learn.
  <p>The question database is the work of the Quizzify staff, with input from many sources, carefully fact-checked and linked.   If you think you’ve found an error, you can win $10 if we agree (good luck with that) by hitting “contact us/report error.”  More than likely, we’ll send you back an explanation of why our answer is right.  For instance, please do not write to us to tell us that we’re wrong, and salt is bad for you.  Nope.  It turns out that, like shrimp, eggs, tropical oils, and even red meat, salt -- in moderation -- has been rehabilitated.  In fact, insufficient salt poses a health hazard too. Don’t believe us?  Google-news it.  In any event, our answers don’t recommend salting your potato chips.  Rather, we say trying to “focus” on everything means you’ll focus on nothing.  Sugars are way worse for you than salt.  That’s where you need to focus and that’s what you need to minimize. 
  <p>The question-writing staff reports to our Grand Inquisitor, Al Lewis.  Al has hosted two trivia-based TV series in the greater Boston market.  He also wrote the bestselling Newsweek Presents the Ultimate Trivia Game, praised by Games Magazine for its “unusually interesting questions.”   And, here he is, May 27, 1987…on:  Jeopardy!   To this day, he and Alex Trebek remain best buddies.  Not.  Actually, Mr. Trebek is prohibited from talking to the contestants on the day of the tapings, a leftover security precaution dating back to the quiz show scandal.  And in any event he is unlikely to remember Al, who didn’t exactly light up the scoreboard.  (The champ – on Al’s right – is Bob Verini.  Bob went on to win the Tournament of Champions both for the year and later for the decade.  And now we are pleased to announce that he is contributing questions to our database.)  
  Ah, but enough about us.  Let’s talk about you.

  So now you’ve done it.  You saw for yourself that we grab your attention right away.  You laughed, you learned, and admit it:  you want to play some more.   Imagine that!  A “wellness” (really, health education) program that employees are actually going to like!
